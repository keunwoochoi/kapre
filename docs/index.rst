Kapre
=====

Keras Audio Preprocessors - compute STFT, InverseSTFT, Melspectrogram, and others on GPU real-time.
  
Tested on Python 3.6, and 3.7.

Why Kapre?
----------

vs. Pre-computation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* You can optimize DSP parameters
* Your model deployment becomes much simpler and consistent.
* Your code and model has less dependencies

vs. Your own implementation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Quick and easy!
* Consistent with 1D/2D tensorflow batch shapes
* Data format agnostic (`channels_first` and `channels_last`)
* Less error prone - Kapre layers are tested against Librosa (stft, decibel, etc) - which is (trust me) *trickier* than you think.
* Kapre layers have some extended APIs from the default `tf.signals` implementation such as..
  - A perfectly invertible `STFT` and `InverseSTFT` pair
  - Mel-spectrogram with more options
* Reproducibility - Kapre is available on pip with versioning

Workflow with Kapre
-------------------

1. Preprocess your audio dataset. Resample the audio to the right sampling rate and store the audio signals (waveforms).
2. In your ML model, add Kapre layer e.g. `kapre.time_frequency.STFT()` as the first layer of the model.
3. The data loader simply loads audio signals and feed them into the model
4. In your hyperparameter search, include DSP parameters like `n_fft` to boost the performance.
5. When deploying the final model, all you need to remember is the sampling rate of the signal. No dependency or preprocessing!
